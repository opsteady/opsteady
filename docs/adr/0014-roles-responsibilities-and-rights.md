# 14. Roles responsibilities and rights

Date: 2021-09-10

## Status

Status: Accepted on 2021-09-10

Foundation for [0025-kubernetes-bootstrap.md](0025-kubernetes-bootstrap.md) on 2021-10-21

## Context

We recognize **platform-admin**, **platform-developer** and **platform-viewer** as roles on our platform. We however need to define detailed responsibilities and rights per role.

## Decision

While building and extending the platform these responsibilities and rights might change, therefore [track this](../opsteady/roles-responsibilities-and-rights-matrix.md) outside the ADR.

At this moment we have not implemented an actual distinction between the roles. For now admin rights are needed for everything.

## Consequences

Only admin is used, we still need to implement the actual roles and their responsibilities and rights described in the matrix.
