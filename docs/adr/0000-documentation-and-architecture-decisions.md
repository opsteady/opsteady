# 0. Documentation and architecture decisions

Status: Accepted on 2021-08-25

## Context

Describe the type of documentation we have and the importance of each type.

## Decision

**Architecture decisions** uses the [ADR](https://adr.github.io/) format to record decisions. And although called architecture decisions it should consist of any decision that is important for the project and needs to be followed.

**Project documentation** is any documentation that can and will be found as comments in the code, description on how things are done or how they work, anything that is relevant for the project, and the behavior of the platform and will be used by the Opsteady operators.

**User documentation** is documentation that an Opsteady end-user like the developer, tester, etc... needs to do the work required. This documentation might however not be part of this repository.

## Consequences

It might not always be clear when something should be a decision and when just normal documentation. The project and user documentation will in some cases overlap but the goal and the way it is written should differ as the audience is different.
