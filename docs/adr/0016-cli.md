## Context

Describe how the Opsteady CLI works.

## Decision

The goal of the CLI is to simplify things like logging into Vault, deploying or destroying components, and building or releasing them.
This is done by creating a default implementation that follows the same flow and execution method for every component. It makes sure the components are deployed, destroyed, build, released, tested, and validated in the same way. Examples of the things the CLI performs on a run:

- Logs in to Vault and prepares it to be used for any other step after that
- Logs in to the selected platform environment and prepares the credentials for further use
- Prepares any other specific settings that are needed for a particular component
- Fetches all the settings from Vault that a component needs and prepares them to be used
- Handles the rendering of templates where needed
- Executes the desired command

It is important to note that every component can override all the functions and do whatever is needed, if that is required.

Besides the simplification and standardization of the component flow, the CLI also does the following things (which might grow over time):

- Get the Vault token by login using OIDC
- Get credentials for platform cloud environments using Vault
- Get credentials for Kubernetes in an environment using Vault
- Get access to ACR

The CLI also follows some folder constraints but these might get extended over time, therefore they will be registered in [CLI documentation](../opsteady/cli.md)

## Consequences

We need to extend the CLI to handle all required cases to build a platform.
