# 15. Security and Compliance

Date: 2021-09-10

## Status

Status: Accepted on 2021-09-10

## Context

The actual implementation for the security and compliance is present in the code but to be able to track that and have an overview for easy access we need a list of them.

## Decision

The security and compliance list is [tracked outside the ADR](../opsteady/compliance-and-security-list.md). All the items in the list need to have a reference to an ADR which explains the decision that is made.

## Consequences

Having to track a separate list is extra work as the decisions are already in the code and an ADR.
