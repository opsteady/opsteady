Opsteady is a container-based development platform that aims to not only provide an excellent developer experience but also cater to different organizational roles, such as SRE, testers, security officers, business, etc. which are closely related to the software development lifecycle.

## Background

Building a container-based platform requires a lot of knowledge in areas such as infrastructure, cloud, Kubernetes, operations, security, tooling, programming, software delivery processes, etc. Operating such a platform, with the necessary uptime and performance guarantees, requires ongoing life-cycle management which is both time-consuming and complex. We believe that organizations should opt not to build their own platform but instead see if they can find a managed solution that fits their needs.

Opsteady is created to deliver and maintain hundreds of clusters. We suggest that you take inspiration from Opsteady to learn what it takes to deliver a full-blown platform in a controlled and secure way. Using the Opsteady platform directly, by copying or forking, is possible but bear in mind that running a production setup with it, requires that you have a full understanding of everything related to the used technologies, architecture, and processes.

## Origins

The initial idea for a platform started in 2015 and evolved over many years of us helping organizations improve their software delivery processes. We focussed on delivering and maintaining platforms, while at the same time also changing the way organizations work. We were and still are, always looking to increase the quality of the software delivery lifecycle and making sure that developers have a delightful experience while building and operating their software.

Opsteady is a creation of Ivo and Armin, powered by Xebia.
